    "It also iterates through the provided grade schedule and passes grade into the vehicle model function. This is done by dividing distance by maximum distance and looking up the remainder in the distance schedule. The corresponding grade is picked from the grade schedule and used for the next loop. This allows the distance/grade schedule to loop indefinitely, simulating a vehicle driving a circular route."
